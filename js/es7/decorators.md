# @decorators

It is a way of adding functionality to classes. Technically they are
Higher Order Functions (functions that take a function or return a
function — functions that operate on functions)

They allow you to "decorate" your Class with additional functionality,
but without all of the complexity that comes with the use of classical
inheritances.
