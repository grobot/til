# Use zsh (and oh-my-zsh)

Was watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uwW20odwEk)
and saw for the first time saw `zsh` and the autocomplete happiness it
provided. After doing a bunch of searching I came across
[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). The reason it
appeals to me is that I want the perk of zsh without spending a ton of
time dialing it in. It seemed `oh-my-zsh` gave me that.

My current setup:

```bash
ZSH_THEME="miloshadzic"
plugins=(brew colored-man-pages emoji emoji-clock git node npm nvm nyan rand-quote web-search zsh_reload)
```
